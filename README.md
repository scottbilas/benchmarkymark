# BenchMarkyMark

A Twitter conversation got me wanting to compare ToList vs ToArray performance in a few scenarios across a bunch of dotnets.

## Prereqs

* Windows (I have only tested on Windows)
* powershell (I haven't switched to powershell core yet)
* install dotnet-sdk
* install mono-devel

## Usage

./build
./run

Results in `build` as csv files
